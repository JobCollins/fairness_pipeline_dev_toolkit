## [v0.1.0] â€” 2025-10-30

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary
First full release candidate of the **Fairness Pipeline Development Toolkit â€” Measurement Module**.  
Implements end-to-end fairness measurement, validation, and workflow integration.

---

### ðŸ§© Added
- **Metrics Engine**
  - Implemented `demographic_parity_difference`, `equalized_odds_difference`, and `mae_parity_difference`.
  - Supports intersectional groups with `min_group_size` filtering.
  - Unified `FairnessAnalyzer` wrapper for multiple libraries (Fairlearn, Aequitas, Native).

- **Statistical Validation**
  - Bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile, BCa).
  - Bayesian credible intervals for small-n.
  - Effect sizes (`risk_ratio`, `cohen_d`) to quantify disparity magnitude.

- **Workflow Integration**
  - `MLflow` logging of fairness metrics and structured artifacts.
  - `pytest` plugin with `assert_fairness()` for automated CI checks.
  - Command-line interface (`fairpipe validate`) for CSV-based validation.
  - Markdown reporting utility (`to_markdown_report()`).

- **Infrastructure**
  - Multi-environment CI (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) for Python 3.10â€“3.12.
  - Linting (Ruff, Black, isort) and coverage reporting integrated into GitHub Actions.
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality and optional fairness smoke checks.

- **Testing & Documentation**
  - End-to-end system tests validating full pipeline (`run â†’ log â†’ CI â†’ report`).
  - Synthetic fixtures and coverage benchmarks.
  - `demo.ipynb` demonstrating metric computation, confidence intervals, and MLflow tracking.
  - Updated `README.md` and architecture record (`ADR-001-architecture.md`).
